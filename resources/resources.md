# DATA 31500 Resources

Here are references and resources for the course separated by topic. 
This is where we will share links to tutorials, examples, and programming tools.


## Computational notebooks

- Welcome to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16pBJQePbqkz3QFV54L4NIkOn1kwpuRrj#scrollTo=u1wdmFKqylSI)
- Using [Google Colab with GitHub](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)
- UChicago CS guide to [setting up VS Code](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/vscode/about.html).
- Check out [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) as an alternative IDE for R if you don't want to use VS Code or Colab. See also [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron?tab=readme-ov-file), and experimental VS Code clone from R's parent company.

## Data wrangling and modeling tools (in Python)

- Basic [pandas tutor](https://pandastutor.com/) demonstrating common dataframe operations
- [Intro to pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb#scrollTo=JndnmDMp66FL) in Google Colab
- The [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) and [arviz](https://python.arviz.org/en/stable/examples/index.html) APIs for Bayesian statistics workflows in Python.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Python module for ML
- Microsoft's open source Python module for ML interpretability, [interpret](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret/)

## Data wrangling and modeling tools (in R)

-[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is a wonderful tool for data manipulation in R, best coupled with other tools in the broader [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)
- [brms](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/) or Bayesian Regression Models is my preferred modeling tool in R. It has excellent support for a wide variety of regression models, including bespoke specifications such as censored models and mixtures. Sampling from posterior distributions and visualizing them provides a flexible way to query model results.

## Visualization APIs

- Altair is a wonderful vis API for Python. Check out their [user guide](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/data.html), [example gallery](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html), [API](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/API.html), and more on the same website! 
- Altair is actually a wrapper around a JavaScript library called Vega-Lite. If you're interested, check out the [Vega-Lite example gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) to compare its syntax with that of Altair.
- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) are declarative grammars for interactive visualization that compile to [D3](https://d3js.org/) visualizations. Altair leverages this software stack by wrapping python syntax around Vega-Lite. 
- We will use [D3](https://d3js.org/) directly in this course, in addition to other tools, because it's lower level of abstraction is idea for implementing bespoke animations and interactive data interfaces.
- From the creators of popular visualization toolkits like D3, Vega, and Vega-Lite, the University of Washington Interactive Data Lab has graciously made their [visualization curriculum](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum) public! The notebooks posted here give an excellent walkthrough of some topics we'll cover in this course.
- [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is possibly the most flexible and extensible vis API in existence
- Matthew Kay's [ggdist R package](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) for visualizing distributions is build upon ggplot. It's the most expressive tool for rendering uncertainty visualizations hands down.

## Web development

- Brush up on your [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) at the start of the quarter. If these are unfamiliar, this class might be difficult.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is the primary JavaScript framework we will use in this class. Check out their wonderful [tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/) to get started. If you prefer [React](https://react.dev/) or similar, you are welcome to use it.
- We are going to use Svelte with D3 as demonstrated in these [materials from MIT](https://vis-society.github.io/lectures/intro-svelte-d3.html)'s vis curriculum. Check it out to get a head start on the way we are learning web development in this course!
- Importing the [Scrolly](https://svelte.dev/playground/d806d5f6e300426ab4af317d9e1d0cb3?version=3.42.4) Svelte Component is helpful for implementing data stories.

<!-- ## Readings

Here are optional readings for the course separated by topic.

### The value of visualization

- A well regarded [academic article](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~stasko/7450/Papers/vanwijk-vis05.pdf) on the value of visualization.
- Obligatory sharing of [Tufte's Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~jtanderson/teaching/cosc311/fa21/files/tufte.pdf). Classes like this one often assign the first three chapters of this book as reading, probably because Tufte's work is rich with examples. However, Tufte sometimes asserts as design principles ideas that don't hold up when subjected to empirical scrutiny. His work is still viewed by the visualization community, with skepticism, as a wonderful resource.

### The science of visualization design

- This [paper by Cleveland and McGill](http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/www/psy6135/papers/ClevelandMcGill1984.pdf) set a precedent for treating visualization effectiveness as an empirical question. Many papers have followed up on this work, and the findings remain roughly intact.
- [Mackinlay's APT paper](https://info.sice.indiana.edu/~katy/S637-S11/Mackinlay86.pdf) lays out his expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for visualization design. This paper kicked off a long line of work on visualization recommender systems.
- Particularly interesting violations of the expressiveness principle (a.k.a. "tell the truth and nothing but the truth") occur when people's expectations about what a certain kind of chart will show are violated. Among other sources, these expectations are informed by **graphical conventions**, such as the expectations that people have about the semantics of bars and lines addressed in this [paper by Zacks and Tversky](https://dcl.wustl.edu/files/2017/09/zacksmemcog99-12d5ktx.pdf), which I mentioned in class.
- A few years ago, some of my colleagues at Northwestern decided there was too much visualization research for practitioners to keep up with. They led an effort to write this review article summarizing the [science of "what works"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/reader/10.1177/15291006211051956) in data visualization design.

### Cartography

- A nice [survey paper](https://parkerziegler.com/papers/a-need-finding-study-with-users-of-geospatial-data.pdf) on map making tools and why they are mostly hard to use

### Interaction and animation

- Data driven documents ([D3](http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/d3)) is the javascript library that supports most interactive visualizations on the web.
- [Animated Transitions in Statistical Graphics](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2007-AnimatedTransitions-InfoVis.pdf) is an authoritative paper on animation design for visualization.
- Interesting paper on using [animation to show aggregation operations](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2019-AnimatedAggregates-EuroVis.pdf)
- [Animation: Can it facilitate?](https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs448b/papers/Tversky_AnimationFacilitate_IJHCS02.pdf) is a great review article by Barbara Tversky
