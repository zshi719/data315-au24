# DATA 31500

This course is a core requirement for the PhD in Data Science and a graduate-level elective in Computer Science. It is designed to help students interested in research build core competancies for communicating with data, with emphasis on front-end web development and data visualization. DATA 315 provides instruction through a combination of lectures, readings, coding demonstrations, as well as opportunities to practice and hone technical skills through coursework and project-based learning.

Students are expected to enter the course with solid foundations in both programming and statistical modeling. At a minimum, this means that students should be comfortable writing basic algorithms and data wrangling in a scripting language such as Python or R, and students should understand the mathematics behind basic regression models. The course emphasizes JavaScript and front-end web development, so previous experience with JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks will likely benefit students. Students should be comfortable picking up new programming languages as needed for coursework (e.g., installation, setup, self-teaching basic syntax). Regardless of previous preparation, both creating interactive graphics and working with data involve many difficulties that must be confronted with patience and perserverence, but both skills will benefit students tremendously in a wide variety of endeavors. Students are encouraged to apply themselves and grow!



## Course objectives

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:

1. Understand the mental model behind visualization APIs and be able to use them to generate visualizations.
2. Apply principles of perception, statistics, and human-centered design when creating visualizations. 
3. Make data interactive with JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks.
4. Use computational notebooks to write cogent, reproducible analyses.
5. Produce high-quality written reports and verbal presentations about research projects.



## Communication

The primary method of communication between students and instructional staff will be email.

## Coursework

Deliverables for this course include 3 assignments and a project (including proposal, codebase, writen report, and presentation). Students should also keep up with assigned readings and review materials.

### Assignments

Assignments are assessments of core learning objectives in the course. Each assignment involves analyzing and visualizing a specific dataset (either provided by the instructor or chosen based on given criteria). Students are expected to create orginal work; collaboration or copying from any source is not allowed. Assignments are graded based on completeness and quality of submitted work.

### Project

The project serves the purpose of a final in DATA 31500. The project involves using visualization and/or web technology to advance an original research project in the student's area of interest. The project is intentionally open-ended so that it can provide an opportunity for students to work toward their own research objectives. Students are expected to create orginal work; copying from any source is not allowed. Students may work in groups of 1, 2, or 3 people. The project will include the following components:

- **Proposal:** a 2-page write-up motivating and describing the intended work
- **Codebase:** a repository of code demonstrating and documenting the use of visualization and/or web technology in an original research project
- **Writen report:** a 4-page research paper detailing the project's motivations, method or approach, provisional findings, and importance
- **Presentation:** a brief presentation or demonstration of how visualization and/or web technology was used to advance original research


## Evaluation

We use a form of grading known as **specifications grading** in this course. The goal of specifications grading is to help students focus on their mastery of the material and identify areas for improvement as the quarter progresses. Students are encouraged to focus on skills, not on scores.

Final grades will be determined based on assignments the project, which will be graded on an **S/N/U scale**:

- **Satisfactory (S)**: The student demonstrates sufficient mastery of the material. The standard for earning a score of S is high, reflecting the intructor's expectations for student work.
- **Needs Improvement (N)**: The student has put in a good-faith effort to complete the work, but revealed a lack of mastery of the material that can be addressed via concrete feedback.
- **Ungradable (U)**: The student did not submit any work, did not follow directions, or did not complete a sufficient portion of the work assigned (e.g., completed less than half the work).

For each graded deliverable, we evaluate the quality of work and provide feedback. This includes but is not limited to the following criteria:

- *Quality of visualizations:* design choices such as encodings, transformations, and scales, appropriate semantics/semiotics
- *Quality of interaction design:* discoverable and non-buggy interactions, layout that facilitates ease of reading
- *Quality of writing:* clear communication, rhetorical cohesion, logical arguments, and cogent rationales for design and analysis choices
- *Choice of datasets:* whether student-chosen datasets can answer the questions the student poses, support a narrative, and enable visualizations that demonstrate the skills learned in the course
- *Quality of analysis:* whether analysis choices are statistically valid, whether the analysis is robust to arbitrary analysis choices, and whether analysis choices are documented, justified, and reproducible
- *Quality of presentation:* polished slides, clear narrative flow of presentation, confidence in public speaking

The specifications for each assignment and the project include more precise descriptions of what is expected for a score of Satisfactory. 

There are a total of 7 S/N/U scores available in the course, 3 for assignments and 4 for the project.

### Final grades

Final grades are based on the following table. Note that the number of S scores mostly determines the grade, but the number of N scores can make a difference.

| Minimum S Required | Minimum N (or additional S) Required | Final Grade |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------- |
| 7                  | 0                                    | A           |
| 6                  | 1                                    | A-          |
| 5                  | 1                                    | B+          |
| 4                  | 2                                    | B           |
| 4                  | 0                                    | B-          |
| 3                  | 2                                    | C+          |
| 3                  | 1                                    | C           |
| 3                  | 0                                    | C-          |
| 2                  | 2                                    | D+          |
| 2                  | 0                                    | D           |
| 1 and below        | NA                                   | F           |

Consider some examples:

- A student with 7 S, 0 N, and 0 U would get an A
- A student with 6 S, 1 N, and 0 U would get an A-
- A student with 5 S, 2 N, and 0 U would get a B+
- A student with 6 S, 0 N, and 1 U would get a B+
- A student with 5 S, 1 N, and 1 U would get a B
- A student with 4 S, 1 N, and 2 U would get a B-
- A student with 3 S, 1 N, and 3 U would get a C
- A student with 2 S, 1 N, and 4 U would get a D

**Advice for success**: The grading scheme in this class emphasizes *completing all coursework on time*. It is much better to turn in work that is imperfect than to turn in nothing at all.

### Resubmissions

Assignments only (*not the project*) may be resubmitted one time each. If a student receives a score of N or U on an assignment, *they may resubmit that assignment one time for a score bump of up to one increment*. In other words, a resubmission can raise a N to a S or raise a U to a N, but a resubmission cannot raise a U to a S. Thus, students should always make an earnest attempt to submit something rather than missing deadlines. 

**How to resubmit?** Students wishing to resubmit an assignment should email their instructor. Students resubmitting an assignment that at first earned a U should send their instructor a new submission, in the required file format(s), within the allotted timeline (see below). Students resubmitting an assignment that at first earned a N should visit their instructor's office hours prepared to present their revised work and explain how they responded to feedback. Resubmissions that at first earned a N may not be submitted without visiting office hours.

**Conditions on resubmitting:** 

- Students wishing to resubmit an assignment must do so *within three weeks of the assignment's due date*.
- Students may not resubmit the same assignment more than one time.
- A score bump upon resubmission is subject to the same standards as the original round of grading, e.g., the expectation for an S is still high. *Not all resubmissions are guaranteed a score bump.*
<!-- - Resubmissions must go through the instructor, not the TAs, unless the instructor grants explicit permission otherwise. -->

### Late policy

Late submissions are not accepted in this class, except under specific circumstances (see below). Coursework has hard due dates, which students must adhere to. These deadlines are in place to pace the workload of DATA 31500 appropriately and to provide a fair system of accountability. Please bear in mind that the grading scheme for this class (with resubmissions) is set up to absorb a reasonable amount of sub-par work. Turning in something unpolished is much better than not turning in anything at all.

Exceptions to the no late work policy:

- **Resubmissions**: Students may resubmit each assignment once, within three weeks of that assignment's due date. To resubmit an assignment, students should email the instructor (see above). Resubmitted assignments can receive a score change of only one increment, i.e., U to N or N to S. *Resubmission cannot be used for the project due to time constaints at the end of the quarter.*
- **Emergencies**: If you have an emergency and feel it warrants an exception to the no late work policy, you should email your instructor. Emergencies entail conditions beyond the student's control that make it infeasible for them to complete coursework on time. This policy is not intended to provide relief for failures of time management and should not be abused. Your instructor does not need to know all the details of your emergency, but they need to know enough to assess whether the situation is truly an emergency. Please err on the side of not sharing any information that you are uncomfortable discussing with your instructor. In some cases, your instructor may advise you to contact the director of your graduate program, to ensure that any proper university or department policies are followed (e.g., an injury might require Student Disability Services accommodations). Contacting us as early as is practical given the emergency makes the process of accommodating your situation work more smoothly. We care about your well-being and success in the class.

No other exceptions will be made.

### Grade disputes

Except in very specific cases (described below), you cannot dispute the score assigned to you on a piece of work. The score you receive on a piece of work is meant to convey feedback on your level of mastery, and you should take it as an opportunity to understand the areas for improvement in your work. You are welcome to ask us for concrete advice about how to improve your work; we are always happy to have those kind of conversations with students, including going over your code or writing. On the other hand, we will not entertain requests to change your score just because you feel your work deserved a higher score.

There is **one exception** to the no grade disputes policy: if a grader made a *factual mistake* in grading your work. Please note that this only includes cases where a grader makes an erroneous statement about your code or writing in their feedback. It does not include cases where you simply disagree with whether something deserves to be flagged as incorrect.

For example, suppose you receive a piece of feedback that says "Poor choice of encoding for data type: Student used a part-to-whole representation for non-proportion data”. If the encoded data in question was actually proportion data, and the grader missed this fact (and erroneously gave you that feedback), you can ask us to review this decision. Please note that, even if the feedback is amended, it may not affect your actual S/N/U score depending on how many other issues were identified in your work.

We ask that you keep these requests brief and to the point: no more than a few sentences identifying the exact statement that the grader made and the reasons you believe the statement was mistaken, including references to specific parts of your code or writing (e.g., “I said that these are proportion data in paragraph 2 of the submitted report.”). Focus on laying out the facts, and nothing else. **Regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope, not via email.**

Regrade requests are distinct from assignment resubmissions (see above).

Finally, it is also your responsibility to make these requests in a timely manner. **Requests to review grading mistakes must be submitted no later than one week after a graded piece of work is returned to you.** After that time, we will not consider any such requests, regardless of whether the request is reasonable and justified. 

We will not accept any request to review grading after **December 13** because grades are due soon after.



## Software tools

Students in DATA 31500 are expected to take responsibility for filling in gaps in their understanding of any software they use to complete their coursework. This goes especially for students who are new to a given programming language or software tool.

Most work in this class will be conducted using:

- scripting languages like Python and R
- computational notebooks
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
- visualization APIs like Altair, ggplot2, D3, VegaLite
- the lightweight JavaScript framework Svelte

We will demonstrate how to work with JavaScript, visualization APIs, and Svelte. *Otherwise, students are responsible for learning to use and troubleshoot whatever software tools they adopt to complete their coursework.*

In particular, course staff will not help you install software or troubleshoot environment setup issues since these problems are tangential to our learning objectives, and students who are adequately prepared for the course should be able to navigate these kinds of problems independently.



## Code of conduct

**Diversity and Inclusion**: Students are expected to treat each other with respect and to give due consideration to each other's stances and positions. Discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated, along the lines of gender identity, sexuality, disability, generational status, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religion, national origin, culture, or otherwise. Please see the UChicago [Commitment on Diversity](https://diversityandinclusion.uchicago.edu/commitment/). Additionally, we are committed to providing equitable access to education at UChicago. Students who have been approved for academic accommodations through [Student Disability Services (SDS)](https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/) should follow the procedures established by SDS for using accommodations. Regardless of identity or status with SDS, students with concerns or questions about issues of diversity and inclusion should email the instructor.

**Academic Integrity**: We take academic honesty seriously in this class. This means students must not collaborate or copy directly from outside sources on coursework, which is meant to be non-collaborative. If students do rely on a particular example to seed a piece of their code (which is common practice in visualization), they should link to the code they used for inspiration in a comment. Students are not permitted to use automated assistants such *ChatGPT* or *GitHub CoPilot* for coursework; use of these technologies in this class is considered an academic honesty violation. Additionally, students should be aware of the UChicago policy on [Academic Honesty and Plagiarism](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-policies/academic-honesty-plagiarism/). The gist of academic integrity is that you should always do and submit your own work.

**Sexual Misconduct**: Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Sexual misconduct is completely unacceptable at UChicago (and anywhere else), including any interactions that occur related to this course. For related resources, please see the UChicago website about [Title IX and Sexual Misconduct](https://equalopportunityprograms.uchicago.edu/title-ix-and-university-policy/). Students seeking help or guidance related to an incident of sexual misconduct will be supported. Students should be aware that, in certain situations, the University may have an institutional obligation to respond to a report of sexual misconduct and that, as a faculty member, *your instructor is required by Title IX and the University of Chicago to report incidents of sexual misconduct*, even if students request to keep the information confidential. If you would like to speak to someone confidentially about an incident of sexual misconduct, please see the University's [Confidential Resources](https://equalopportunityprograms.uchicago.edu/confidential-resources/).

**Student Health and Wellness**: Student's mental and physical health are of primary importance both for reasons of common human dignity and to create a suitable learning environment at UChicago. If you or someone you know needs or might benefit from mental health services, please consider reaching out to [UChicago Student Wellness](https://wellness.uchicago.edu/mental-health/), whose services do not come at any additional cost to students.

**If you are sick, please do not come to class or in-person office hours.** If you need to miss class because of an illness, please email your instructor. Students who have been exposed to or who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact [UChicago Student Wellness](https://wellness.uchicago.edu/) to be tested. If you were potentially exposed to COVID-19 or your COVID-19 test results come back positive, please reach out immediately to C19HealthReport@uchicago.edu. Other public health concerns should be directed to [UCAIR](https://ucair.uchicago.edu/). If there is an emergency, please call 773-702-8181 or dial 123 on any campus phone, or call 911 for emergency response.

**Attendance and Participation**: DATA 31500 is 100% in-person. If students need to miss class for some reason, they should ask their peers to share notes from the missed class. *We will not record lectures*, however, we are happy to discuss what was missed during office hours. Please do not email the instructional staff with requests for a summary of missed lectures; we will tell you to ask a peer for notes and/or visit us at office hours.
